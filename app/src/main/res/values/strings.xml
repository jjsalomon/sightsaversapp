    <string name="RiverB_Text">River Blindness is a tropical disease caused by a parasitic worm and transmitted by the bite of the black fly. The fly bite passes worm larvae into your skin, the worms breed and spread around your body, and when they die your immune system causes inflammation, which can blind you if it happens in your eyes.</string>

    <string name="trachomaText">Trachoma Starts off as a highly contagious bacterial infection which can be easily treated. If untreated, over time it makes your eyelashes turn inward so with every blink they’re scraping your eyeball. It is unbearably painful and eventually causes blindness.</string>
